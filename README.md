# My Personal Website

Welcome to the repository of my personal website! This project was built using React.js and consists of four main components: Home, About Me, Portfolio, and Contact Me. Additionally, a navigation bar is included to easily navigate between these sections. The project is styled using CSS for a clean and visually appealing user interface.

**Project Overview**

This personal website serves as a platform to showcase my skills, projects, and connect with visitors. It includes the following components:

**1. Home:** The landing page that provides a brief introduction and welcome message.

**2. About Me:** A section where I share information about myself, including my background, interests, and skills.

**3. Portfolio:** A collection of my notable projects, each with a description and link to view more details.

**4. Contact Me:** A page with contact information and a contact form to enable visitors to get in touch.

**5. Navigation Bar:** A fixed navigation bar at the top of the page that allows users to easily switch between sections.

**Features**

**1. Responsive Design:** The website is designed to be responsive and work well on various screen sizes, from desktop to mobile devices.

**4. Easy Navigation:** The navigation bar at the top of the page provides intuitive navigation between sections.

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
